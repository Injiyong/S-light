## üíÅ‚Äç Introduction
Our project is lighting with color therapy. Color therapy is a combination of ‚Äòcolor‚Äô and 'therapy', a mental therapy that uses the energy and properties of color in psychotherapy and medicine to relieve stress and improve life. 'S-light' analyzes user's emotions through user input and recommends the appropriate color to expect color therapy effect.

### ‚úî Color Change

### ‚úî Voice recognition
> When one expresses one's feelings in words through voice recognition, the lights are turned on accordingly. The analysis begins after a certain period of time after the speech. To capture the feelings of the moment, the analysis is designed to proceed if silence persists instead of ON/OFF. The analysis is carried out naturally because some delay was given after talking.
